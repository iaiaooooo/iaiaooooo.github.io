After a research phase, I chose a chessboard as the central object: simple, intriguing, and embodying a sense of play and anticipation that could appeal to a diverse audience. The chessboard is designed to resemble a book: it closes like a bound volume, with a spine that mimics a classic cover, and the pieces inside are neatly arranged like books on a shelf. ",

            "text":"I also conceptualized a window display strategy to heighten the sense of discovery. In the first display, the shadow of a chess piece is projected onto a white panel using a low, frontal light, creating visual compositions that tie back to the theme of libraries. In the second display, oversized chess pieces are arranged in a sequence, with some hidden behind others, continuing the theme of concealment. This project plays with the idea of hide-and-seek, the allure of the unknown, and the power of curiosity.",
