Starting from their request for a rebranding for my thesis project, I developed a new visual identity and created four seasonal packaging designs that transform food into pieces for board games. Sandwiches for Terni Lapilli, pastries for Alquerque, crackers for Tria, and chocolates for Chess. I also designed illustrated coasters and a concept for the shop windows, drawing inspiration from the elegance of the café and playing with the contrast between tradition and simple geometries.",
